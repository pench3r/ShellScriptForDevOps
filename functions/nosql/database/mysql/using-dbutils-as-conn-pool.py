Description:            Python implementation of database connection pool
Long Description:

[PersistentDB or PooledDB, Which one to use?](https://webwareforpython.github.io/DBUtils/UsersGuide.html)
So which of these two modules should you use? From the above explanations it is clear that
PersistentDB will make more sense if your application keeps a constant number of threads which
frequently use the database. In this case, you will always have the same amount of open database connections.
However, if your application frequently starts and ends threads, then it will be better to use PooledDB.
The latter will also allow more fine-tuning, particularly if you are using a thread-safe DB-API 2 module.

If you are using one of the popular object-relational mappers
[SQLObject](http://www.sqlobject.org/) or [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/),
you won't need DBUtils, since they come with their own connection pools.
