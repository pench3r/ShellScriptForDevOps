Description:            test how many processes(include threads) can a user(not root) create
Long Description:       nproc(max user processes) is include all process and thread number of same user,
                        root is no limit usually

                        The threads will have the same PID but only when viewed from above.
                        What you (as a user) call a PID is not what the kernel (looking from below) calls a PID.
                        In the kernel, each thread has it's own ID, called a PID (although it would possibly make more
                        sense to call this a TID, or thread ID) and they also have a TGID (thread group ID) which
                        is the PID of the thread that started the whole process.
                        Simplistically, when a new process is created, it appears as a thread where
                        both the PID and TGID are the same (new) number.
                        When a thread starts another thread, that started thread gets its own PID (so the scheduler can
                        schedule it independently) but it inherits the TGID from the original thread.
                        That way, the kernel can happily schedule threads independent of what process they belong to,
                        while processes (thread group IDs) are reported to you.
