# Method2:
"""
CRLF to LF line separator
Important: using Binary Mode 'rb' or 'wb'
We need to make sure that we open the file both times in binary mode (mode='rb' and mode='wb') 
for the conversion to work.
When opening files in text mode (mode='r' or mode='w' without b), 
the platform's native line endings (\r\n on Windows and \r on old Mac OS versions) are automatically 
converted to Python's Unix-style line endings: \n. 
So the call to content.replace() couldn't find any line endings to replace.
In binary mode, no such conversion is done.
