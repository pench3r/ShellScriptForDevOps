    # current is a symlink pointing to the latest release. This symlink is updated at the end of a successful deployment. If the deployment fails in any step the current symlink still points to the old release.
    # releases holds all deployments in a timestamped folder. These folders are the target of the current symlink.
    # repo holds the version control system configured. In case of a git repository the content will be a raw git repository (e.g. objects, refs, etc.).
    # revisions.log is used to log every deploy or rollback. Each entry is timestamped and the executing user (username from local machine) is listed. Depending on your VCS data like branchnames or revision numbers are listed as well.
    # shared contains the linked_files and linked_dirs which are symlinked into each release. This data persists across deployments and releases. It should be used for things like database configuration files and static and persistent user storage handed over from one release to the next.
